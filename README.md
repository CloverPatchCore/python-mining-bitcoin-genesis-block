# Bitcoin Mining in Python
A Python implementation of the Bitcoin mining algorithm

This small script is a pseudo-simulation of the Bitcoin Genesis block mining process.

Given the Genesis block's data, this script double-hashes it using SHA-256 and attempts to find a hash less than the Genesis target.
